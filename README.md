# Tiny-Language
In this project, we build the small compiler and we apply two phases (Scanner & Parser)

Project Modules
Milestone 1
In milestone 1 we built a Scanner phase which we read the language and take the tokens and the wrong words we put it in error list

Milestone 2
In Milestone 2 we built a Parser phase which we make the grammar of the language by making parsing tree and every branch of the tree contain the block of the code
